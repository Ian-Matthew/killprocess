          ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Ian Matthew. I typically answer yes to all of the above so
          I made this dumb website to help others like me. If you answered yes
          to any of these questions, you can use{" "}
          <InlineLink href="/">the dumb thing here</InlineLink> and bookmark it
          for later.

          can use the <InlineLink href="/bash">bash script</InlineLink> and
